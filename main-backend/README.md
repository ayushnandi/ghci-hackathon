Clerk integration notes

1) Install backend dependency

```powershell
cd main-backend
npm install
```

Add or verify that `@clerk/clerk-sdk-node` is installed (package.json updated).

2) Environment variables (add to `main-backend/.env`):

- `CLERK_API_KEY` = Your Clerk API Key (server)
- `FRONTEND_URL` = URL of frontend (already used by CORS)
- `MONGO_URI`, etc.

3) Usage

- Frontend uses Clerk for authentication. After sign-in on frontend, call the backend endpoint to sync the user:

```
POST {FRONTEND_URL}/api/v1/auth/clerk/sync
Authorization: (Clerk session cookies or Authorization header generated by Clerk client)
```

The backend uses Clerk middleware to validate the session, fetch the Clerk user via the Clerk API, then create or update a `User` document (role set to `clerk`, `clerkId` populated). The request will return the synced user document.

4) Notes

- Ensure `CLERK_API_KEY` is set so backend can fetch Clerk user metadata.
- If you prefer, the frontend may POST the Clerk user payload to the same endpoint; the backend will accept either the middleware-fetched user or a `clerkUser`/`clerkId` in the body.
