## 🧠 How It Works (Flow)

1. User speaks → LiveKit streams audio  
2. AssemblyAI converts speech → text  
3. GPT-4.1 interprets intent + calls appropriate tools  
4. Backend executes banking operations  
5. Response is synthesized via Sonic-3 TTS  
6. LiveKit streams audio back to the user  

The entire pipeline operates in **real-time**, creating a fluid and human-like conversational experience.
