## 🎯 Project Overview

Banking apps today are packed with features but still make users dig through menus for basic tasks.  
FinChorus fixes that by letting users talk to their bank directly using natural voice commands.

It brings together real-time audio streaming, solid backend systems and smart reasoning to create a smooth, almost human experience.



## 🧩 Core Features

### 1. Voice Based Banking
FinChorus understands everyday language for tasks like:

- Checking balances
- Guiding and controlling the interface
- Mock fund transfers
- Viewing recent transactions
- Asking about loans, interest rates or credit limits
- Setting reminders or alerts

### 2. Real Time Conversational Intelligence
- STT: AssemblyAI Universal Streaming  
- LLM: OpenAI GPT 4.1 mini with tool calling  
- TTS: Cartesia Sonic 3 for quick natural voice  
- Audio transport: LiveKit Agents for low latency

### 3. Secure User Authentication
- Clerk for identity and sessions  
- Backend validation for sensitive operations  
- Safe mock data so users can test freely

### 4. Modular Architecture
FinChorus is split into clean, independent services that can be deployed and tested separately.  
This keeps everything simple, scalable and easy for judges to understand.
