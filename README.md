## 🎯 Project Overview

Banking apps today are packed with features but still make users dig through menus for basic tasks.  
FinChorus fixes that by letting users talk to their bank directly using natural voice commands.

It brings together real-time audio streaming, solid backend systems and smart reasoning to create a smooth, almost human experience.

## 🧩 Core Features

### 1. Voice Based Banking
FinChorus understands everyday language for tasks like:

- Checking balances
- Guiding and controlling the interface
- Mock fund transfers
- Viewing recent transactions
- Asking about loans, interest rates or credit limits
- Setting reminders or alerts
- Automatically understand and perform actions in the user's language.
- Create relationships between users.
- Instantly check any detail via self generating UI components.

### 2. Real Time Conversational Intelligence
- STT: AssemblyAI Universal Streaming  
- LLM: OpenAI GPT 4.1 mini with tool calling  
- TTS: Cartesia Sonic 3 for quick natural voice  
- Audio transport: LiveKit Agents for low latency

### 3. Secure User Authentication
- Clerk for identity and sessions  
- Backend validation for sensitive operations  
- Safe mock data so users can test freely

### 4. Modular Architecture
FinChorus is split into clean, independent services that can be deployed and tested separately.  
This keeps everything simple, scalable and easy for judges to understand.

### 5. Fully Responsive
- Built in mind to deploy as a PWA along with customized ShadCn, TailwindCSS and server rendered components.

## ⚙️ Tech Stack

### Agent Service (Python)
- LiveKit Agents  
- GPT 4.1 mini  
- AssemblyAI STT  
- Cartesia Sonic 3  
- Backend tool integration
- Server 
### Backend (Node + Express)
- REST APIs for accounts, balances and transactions  
- MongoDB for mock data  
- Clerk auth  
- CORS and session handling

### Frontend (Next.js + Clerk)
- Voice room interface  
- LiveKit client components  
- Secure login  
- Real time responses
- Updates via voice commands for each user scalabely

## 🧠 How It Works

1. User logs in and joins a secure room 
2. User speaks and LiveKit streams the audio  
3. AssemblyAI converts audio to text
4. GPT 4.1 mini understands intent and triggers tools  
5. Backend performs the requested operation  
6. Cartesia Sonic 3 generates a natural voice response  
7. LiveKit streams it back instantly
8. User then can follow up, ask questions, perform actions all via voice.  

Everything works in real time and feels smooth to use with the ability to create actions and perform operations on the frontend as well as the backend.
